## Introduction
This project automates the process of reading customer queries and responding to them. It includes several scripts designed to interact with a user interface, find coordinates for UI elements, and automate the pasting of responses.

## Features
- **Automated Cursor Positioning**: Identify and verify UI element coordinates.
- **Automated Question Reading**: Read and copy customer queries.
- **Automated Response Pasting**: Paste responses into the appropriate UI fields.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `pyautogui` library
- `pyperclip` library


2. **Install the required libraries**:
   ```sh
   pip install pyautogui pyperclip
   ```

## Usage
1. **Find UI Coordinates**:
   Run `01_get_cursor.py` to determine the coordinates of the UI elements you need to interact with.
   ```sh
   python 01_get_cursor.py
   ```

   - Move your mouse to the desired position and press `Ctrl+C` to copy the coordinates.
   - Note the coordinates displayed in the terminal.

2. **Update Coordinates**:
   Edit `03_bot.py` with the coordinates you obtained. Replace the placeholder coordinates in the `read_question` and `paste_response` functions.

3. **Run the Automation Script**:
   Execute `03_bot.py` to start the automated customer support process.
   ```sh
   python 03_bot.py
   ```

## Scripts
- **01_get_cursor.py**:
  - Helps you find and verify the coordinates for various elements in your UI.
  
- **03_bot.py**:
  - Automates the reading of questions and pasting of responses based on the coordinates obtained.
